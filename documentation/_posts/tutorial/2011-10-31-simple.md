# Introduction

Lettuce is an extremely useful and charming tool for BDD_ (Behavior
Driven Development). It can execute plain-text functional descriptions
as automated tests for Python_ projects, just as Cucumber_ does for
Gherkin.

Lettuce_ makes the development and testing process really easy,
scalable, readable and - what is best - it allows someone who doesn't
program to describe the behavior of a certain system, without
imagining those descriptions will automatically test the system during
its development.

## get lettuce

Make sure you've got Python installed and then run from the terminal:

```console
user@machine:~$ [sudo] pip install lettuce
```


## define a problem

Let's choose a problem to lettuce: `**Given a number, what is its factorial?**`

#### note
``
   The factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the
   product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The
   factorial of 0 is 1
``

## project structure

Build the directory tree bellow such as the files `zero.feature` and `steps.py` are empty.

```console
    /home/user/projects/mymath
         | tests
               | features
                    - zero.feature
                    - steps.py
```


## lettuce it!

Lets begin to describe and solve our problem...

### first round


#### [a] describe behaviour

Start describing the expected behaviour of factorial in `zero.feature` using English:

```gherkin
Feature: Compute factorial
    In order to play with Lettuce
    As beginners
    We'll implement factorial

    Scenario: Factorial of 0
        Given I have the number 0
        When I compute its factorial
        Then I see the number 1
```
.. Note::

    zero.feature must be inside features directory and its extension must
    be .feature. However, you're free to choose its name.

#### [b] define steps in python

Now let's define the steps of the scenario, so Lettuce can
understand the behaviour description. Create the `steps.py` file which will contain
python code describing the steps.

Python:

```python
from lettuce import *

@step('I have the number (\d+)')
def have_the_number(step, number):
   world.number = int(number)

@step('I compute its factorial')
def compute_its_factorial(step):
   world.number = factorial(world.number)

@step('I see the number (\d+)')
def check_number(step, expected):
   expected = int(expected)
   assert world.number == expected, \
       "Got %d" % world.number

def factorial(number):
   return -1
```

#### note

   `steps.py` must be inside features directory, but the names doesn't
   need to be `steps.py` it can be any python file with a `.py` extension.
   Lettuce_ will look for python files recursively within features
   dir.

Ideally, factorial will be defined somewhere else. However, as this is
just a first example, we'll implement it inside steps.py, so you get
the idea of how to use Lettuce.

**Notice that, until now, we haven't defined the factorial function (it's returning -1).**

#### [c] run and watch it fail


Go to the tests directory and run from the terminal:

```console
user@machine:~/projects/mymath/tests$ lettuce
```

As you haven't implemented factorial, it is no surprise the behavior
won't be reached:

![{{ site.url }}{{ page.screenshot1_png }}]({{ site.url }}{{ page.screenshot1_png }})

Our only scenario failed :(
Let's solve it...

#### [d] write code to make it pass


Well, by definition, we know that the factorial of 0 is 1. As our only
feature is this... we could force factorial to return 1.

```python
from lettuce import *

@step('I have the number (\d+)')
def have_the_number(step, number):
    world.number = int(number)

@step('I compute its factorial')
def compute_its_factorial(step):
    world.number = factorial(world.number)

@step('I see the number (\d+)')
def check_number(step, expected):
    expected = int(expected)
    assert world.number == expected, \
        "Got %d" % world.number

def factorial(number):
    return 1
```

#### [e] run again and watch it pass

Again, run from the terminal:

```console
user@machine:~/projects/mymath/tests$ lettuce
```

And you'll be happy to see your factorial implementation passed all the behaviours expected:

![{{ site.url }}{{ page.screenshot2_png }}]({{ site.url }}{{ page.screenshot2_png }})

Great! :)

However, one test is not enough for checking the quality of our
solution... So let's lettuce it again!

### second round

Let's provide more tests so our problem is better described, and so we
provide a more accurate implementation of factorial:

#### [a] describe behaviour

Let's provide two new scenarios, for numbers 1 and 2:

```gherkin
Feature: Compute factorial
  In order to play with Lettuce
  As beginners
  We'll implement factorial

  Scenario: Factorial of 0
    Given I have the number 0
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 1

  Scenario: Factorial of 1
    Given I have the number 1
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 1

  Scenario: Factorial of 2
    Given I have the number 2
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 2
```
#### [b] define steps in python

As we haven't changed the definition, no need to make changes on this
step.

#### [c] run and watch it fail

```console
user@machine:~/projects/mymath/tests$ lettuce
```

When running Lettuce we realize that our previous implementation of
factorial works fine both for 0 and for 1, but not for 2 - it
fails. :(

#### [d] write code to make it pass

Let's provide a solution so we get the right factorial for all
scenarios, specially for number 2:

```python
from lettuce import *

@step('I have the number (\d+)')
def have_the_number(step, number):
    world.number = int(number)

@step('I compute its factorial')
def compute_its_factorial(step):
    world.number = factorial(world.number)

@step('I see the number (\d+)')
def check_number(step, expected):
    expected = int(expected)
    assert world.number == expected, \
        "Got %d" % world.number

def factorial(number):
    number = int(number)
    if (number == 0) or (number == 1):
        return 1
    else:
        return number
```

#### [e] run again and watch it pass


```console
user@machine:~/projects/mymath/tests$ lettuce
```

![{{ site.url }}{{ page.screenshot4_png }}]({{ site.url }}{{ page.screenshot4_png }})

Great! Three scenarios described and they are alright!

### third round

Let's provide more tests so our problem is better described and we get
new errors so we'll be able to solve them.

#### [a] describe behaviour


```gherkin
Feature: Compute factorial
  In order to play with Lettuce
  As beginners
  We'll implement factorial

  Scenario: Factorial of 0
    Given I have the number 0
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 1

  Scenario: Factorial of 1
    Given I have the number 1
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 1

  Scenario: Factorial of 2
    Given I have the number 2
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 2

  Scenario: Factorial of 3
    Given I have the number 3
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 6

  Scenario: Factorial of 4
    Given I have the number 4
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 24
```

#### [b] define steps in python


As we haven't changed the definition, no need to make changes on this
step.

#### [c] run and watch it fail


```console
user@machine:~/projects/mymath/tests$ lettuce
```
![{{ site.url }}{{ page.screenshot5_png }}]({{ site.url }}{{ page.screenshot5_png }})

#### [d] write code to make it pass


```python
from lettuce import *

@step('I have the number (\d+)')
def have_the_number(step, number):
    world.number = int(number)

@step('I compute its factorial')
def compute_its_factorial(step):
    world.number = factorial(world.number)

@step('I see the number (\d+)')
def check_number(step, expected):
    expected = int(expected)
    assert world.number == expected, \
        "Got %d" % world.number

def factorial(number):
    number = int(number)
    if (number == 0) or (number == 1):
        return 1
    else:
        return number*factorial(number-1)
```
#### [e] run again and watch it pass


```console
user@machine:~/projects/mymath/tests$ lettuce
```

![{{ site.url }}{{ page.screenshot6_png }}]({{ site.url }}{{ page.screenshot6_png }})

### forth round


All steps should be repeated as long as you can keep doing them - the
quality of your software depends on these.

Have a nice lettuce...! ;)
